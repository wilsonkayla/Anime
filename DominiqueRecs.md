> At Grace Field House, life couldn't be any better for the orphans.  Although the children live together as siblings, they are not related. Grace Field House is where
children without parents live. An irreplaceable orphanage for 38 children who all live seemingly perfect lives every day and a loving "Mama" who cared for them deeply.
Their home was nice, bellies were full, and their caretaker loved them very much. No child was overlooked and would be adopted by the age of 12. In their daily lives, they
go over rigorous courseworks and tests but enjoy hours of playtime outside. However there was one rule they must obey: *do not leave the orphanage*.
But one day, the top-scoring orphans, Emma and Norman, venture past the gate and unearth the harrowing secret behind their entire existence. Utilizing their quick-wittedness,
the children must work together to somehow change their predetermined fate. the happy days at Grace Field House turn out to be a false paradise.
In truth, their home isn't an orphanage, but a farm, and the children aren't orphans, but cattle, destined to be slaughtered and sold as human meat for demons.
Meanwhile, the mom they love is actually a watchdog working for the demons.
